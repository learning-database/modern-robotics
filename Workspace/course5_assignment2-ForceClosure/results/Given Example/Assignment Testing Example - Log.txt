TEST SCENARIO - COLLAPSING ASSEMBLY
===================================

$ python course5_assignment2.py 
#### This program will check if a given planar assembly is in force closure ####

Enter the list of bodies. 
Each element should be of format (ID,x,y,mass):
	BodyID : Unique ID from 0 to Number of bodies
	(x,y)  : coordinates of body mass center
	 mass  : body mass in Kilograms
Note: BodyID 0 is stationary ground
	i.e. [[1, 25, 35, 2], [2, 66, 42, 10]]
Bodies List: [[1, 25, 35, 2], [2, 66, 42, 5]]

Enter the list contact points. 
Each element should be of format (bodyA, bodyB, x, y, theta, u):
	Contact from bodyB into bodyA
	(x,y) : Coordinates of contact point
	theta : Angle of contact normal into bodyA (in Radians)
	 u : Coulomb Friction Coefficient
	i.e. 
		[[1, 2, 60, 60, 3.1416, 0.5], 
		[1, 0, 0, 0, 1.5708, 0.5], 
		[2, 0, 60, 0, 1.5708, 0.5], 
		[2, 0, 72, 0, 1.5708, 0.5]]
Contacts List: [[1, 2, 60, 60, 3.1416, 0.5], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1.5708, 0.1], [2, 0, 60, 0, 1.5708, 0.5], [2, 0, 72, 0, 1.5708, 0.5]]
