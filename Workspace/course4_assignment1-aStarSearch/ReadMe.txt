Make sure you have python 2 installed with following libraries.
       CSV Library

To run the code, go to the /code directory and simply run the course2_assignment.py file.
  Linux Example: 
           Open a terminal and go to "code" folder
           Execute "python course4_assignment1.py"

The code will save a file called "path.csv" in the /code directory.

NOTE
=======
Make sure you have copied the "nodes.csv" and "edges.csv" files from the /results directory,
to /code directory before running the code. Otherwise the code will quit giving an error.
