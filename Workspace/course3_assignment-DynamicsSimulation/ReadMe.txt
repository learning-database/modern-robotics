Make sure you have python 2 installed with following libraries.
       Numpy
       Modern Robotics library
       CSV Library

When you run the python program, you have the option to select which simulation to run
(Simulation scenario 1 or Simulation scenario 2 of the assignment)

Run the python file and enter the simulation number (1 or 2)
      Example: In linux, open a terminal and type "python course3_assignment.py"
               To Run first simulation, type 1 in the terminal and press Enter.
               To Run second simulation, type 2 in the terminal and press Enter.
      
The code will automatically generate a CSV file named simulationX.csv in the execution directory.
where X is 1 or 2 depending on which simulation you ran.
